## SAA-C02
1. Autoscaling group, post-peak hours with data loss => Lifecycle hooks

1. Scenarios for Elastic Beanstalk => Worker environment with SQS, Auto Scaling group and applications servers, Capacity provisioning, load balancing of website, web application using Amazon RDS
1. Post-CloudFormation-changes, Drift Detection => Explicitly set the property value
1. Get source IP address, cost-optimized => VPC Flow Logs
1. High performance computing (HPC) => Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), cluster placement group, FSx for Lustre, ParallelCluster
1. Connect region-1 EC2 to region-2 DynamoDB privatly => VPC peering, VPC endpoint
1. No access direclty from S3 url, fetch only through CloudFront => Origin access identity (OAI)
1. Limited time access S3 url => CloudFront origin with pre-signed URL
1. User-based website access S3 => CloudFront origin with signed cookies
1. CloudFront, PCI compliance => CloudFront access logs, capture resquests to CloudFront API
1. CloudWatch alarms, invoke the scaling policy, Auto Scaling group does not respond => warm-up time
1. Secrets Manager, API keys => Lambda function that rotates the secrets
1. Stack-based model for different envoronments => OpsWorks Stacks.
1. Multiple VPCs, private interaction S3-DynamoDB => VPC Gateway Endpoint, update route table
1. PCI compliance, web application logs, monitor malicious activity => CloudWatch Logs, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail
1. Network architecture cost-optimized, manage egress traffic with flexibility => Transit Gateway in one central account, hub and spoke, redundant NAT gateway
1. Data in S3, high-performance storage, several instances reading and writing data based on S3 => FSx for Lustre 
1. Saving plan, different types of EC2 family => Computing Saving Plan
1. Saving plan, one set of EC2 family => EC2 Instance Saving Plan
1. Saving plan, RDS => Reserved Instances
1. Connectivity from VPCs, Intranet application, internal network => Network Load Balancer with VPC enpoint (PrivateLink)
1. CloudHSM, perform secure backup => Ephemeral backup key (EBK) is used to encrypt data & Persistent backup key (PBK) is used to encrypt EBK
1. Auto Scaling gourps, scaling activity, time to stabilize => Auto Scaling Cooldown timer value
1. On-premisses messaging application, run parallel with cloud, suport JSM API, AMQP, MQTT => Amazon MQ
1. RDS, increase number of conections => Configure new parameter group and attach it
1. S3, sensitive data, encrypted at rest, keys managed by in-house team => Generate data key with Customer managed CMKs, encrypt data and delete plain text key; store encrypted data and data key in S3. Use CMK to decrypt data key and decryted data key to decrypt data.
1. Redis Clusters, secure access from EC2 in different VPC => Transit Gateway; Redis AUTH
1. CodePipeline, fast trigger => Disabled periodic checks, create an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and CloudTrail.
1. S3 buckets across many accounts, centralize in one audit account => centralize buckets per account and enable replication to audit S3 account.
1. S3 data, copy to another region-S3 => Enable versioning on both S3, enable cross-region replication
1. S3, encrypted at rest, in-house managed keys, auto encrypt-decrypt process => S3 server-side encryption with Customer keys.
1. Redshift Cluster, data available in another region => Cross-region snapshots for Redshift
1. Optimum number of Kineses Shards, automated solution => Application Auto Scaling, Kinesis Scaling Utility with Elastic Beanstalk
1. EBS, Provsioned IOPS => IO-intensive databases
1. EBS, Throughput Optimized => big data, warehouses, log 
1. EFS, performance mode, latency-sensitive, low-latency, default => General Purpose
1. EFS, performance mode, higher levels of throughput, slightly higher latencies => Max I/O
1. EFS, throughput mode, short periods throughputs, default => EFS bursting throughput 
1. EFS, throughput mode, high sustained throughput, extra-cost => EFS provisioned throughput
1. CloudFront, reduce request costs, increase cache duration => Cache-control header
1. CloudFormation, spot instances => OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity 0
1. Deployed REST API, AWS API Gateway, public, control access to costumers => enable CORS with hostnames; set IPs in resouce policy; generate client certificates
1. ECS, task definition => JSON template, describes container itself
1. ECS, service definition => JSON template, describes a container's environment, roles
1. ECS instances accessing AWS ECS endpoint => have public IP; create interface vpc endpoint and route it
1. ECS is not getting information back from the container agent => interface vpc enpoint not configured
1. RDS, hybrid architecture, read-replica on-premise, secure connection => IPsec VPN connection through VPC, and configure replication
1. Secrets Manager, if rotation is not enabled for a secret, email notification => rule “secretsmanager-rotation-enabled-check” in AWS Config
